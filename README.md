# STAT-CourseWork
Avanced statistics course work at Centrale Lyon 

## Objectives
The objective of this course is to provide the classic tools of mathematical statistics which includes the choice of the probabilistic
model, its estimation and its evaluation. We will be particularly interested in the linear model and its extensions in the context of
high-dimensional statistical learning (LASSO, RIDGE, PCR PLS), the logistic model and tree-based models (CART, RF,
Boosting etc. ). The aim of this course is also to provide training in the manipulation of data and the practical implementation of
the studied models. For this, a substantial part of the course is oriented towards the implementation of the different models
using the R software through the study of a large number of examples.
